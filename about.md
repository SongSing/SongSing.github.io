My name is Mina Kemp and I am an angel (like from EVA).

I'm a Computer Science graduate (December 2020), and I'm primarily interested in creating things.

Examples of these things can be found on the [projects page](/projects.html), but in general they tend to be web applications, desktop software, or other types of art.

My favorite programming languages are C# and Python, but I am also proficient with JavaScript/TypeScript, C(++), Java, and Ruby.

For a more comprehensive list of my projects (i.e. everything I have not finished) you can check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SongSing">Github</a>. Pretty much everything I make is open-source!
