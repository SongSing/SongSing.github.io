My name is Mina Kemp and I am an angel (like from EVA).

I'm a Computer Science student graduating in December 2020, and I'm primarily interested in creating things.

Wow, that's really vague. But that's just because I tend to make a lot of (not necessarily related) things, such as web and desktop applications, electronic music, video games, and written stories.

To see some of my work, check out the [projects page](/projects.html)!

You can also check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SongSing">Github</a> if you want! Pretty much everything I make is open-source.

Okay bye :)
