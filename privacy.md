I use Google Analytics to anonymously collect information such as the amount of pageviews and number of visitors the site receives, which types of devices access the site, and where users access the site from (what states and cities). This information is not linked to you as a person (i.e. I can't see where you specifically live or anything, just that there is someone from whatever city that has accessed the site).

The only way this data is used by me is I like to see how many people go on the site for archival and curiousity purposes. The only data that is shared with anyone other than myself is the amount of pageviews or visitors that the site receives. (YEP I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE VIEWS...)

If the idea of contributing to a pageview counter scares you, Google provides <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">a way to opt out of Google Analytics.<a/>
