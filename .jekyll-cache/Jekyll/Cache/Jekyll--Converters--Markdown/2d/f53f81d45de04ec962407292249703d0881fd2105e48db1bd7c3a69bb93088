I"Ñ<p>Web-based photo cropper specifically designed for profile pictures.</p>

<p>Honestly, I made this because Discord didnâ€™t have a built-in avatar cropper like Skype does. Some of my friends had been complaining about this as well, so of course it was up to me to make one.</p>

<p>As of September 2019, this website garners over 3,000 unique weekly visitors, and has allowed me to practice collecting feedback on a project in order to shape its development.</p>
