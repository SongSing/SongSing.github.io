I"J<p>My name is Brandon Kemp, though I usually prefer to go by Alice!</p>

<p>I’m a Computer Science student graduating in December 2020, and I’m primarily interested in creating things.
That’s very vague, but that’s just because I like to make a lot of things, such as web and desktop applications, electronic music, video games, and written stories.</p>

<p>To see some of my work, check out the <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a>!
You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/SongSing">github</a> if you want! Pretty much everything I make is open-source.</p>
