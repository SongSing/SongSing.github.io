I"§<p>My name is Brandon Kemp, though I usually prefer to go by Alice!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science student graduating in December 2020, and Iâ€™m primarily interested in creating things.
Thatâ€™s very vague, but thatâ€™s just because I like to make a lot of things, such as web and desktop applications, electronic music, video games, and written stories.</p>

<p>To see some of my work, check out the projects page!</p>
