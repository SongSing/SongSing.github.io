Music player created in Electron. Developed as a hobby since Winter 2018.

I made this music player because I couldn't find one that met all of my stringent needs and also looked nice. So obviously the only solution was to just make my own.

I think this is one of the first things I made using Electron? Or among the first. Prior to that, I mostly used nw.js (which is pretty similar).

Anyway, I love this project to death because I always feel like "wow I really need some strange solution to this music-organization-related problem" and so it's like... ok I can just make my own now! So a lot of the features are very obscure but it's just so I can have my music-organization compulsions satisfied. :~)
