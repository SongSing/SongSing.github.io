Web-based photo cropper specifically designed for profile pictures. Under spare-time development since July 2017.

Honestly, I made this because Discord didn't have a built-in avatar cropper like Skype does. Some of my friends had been complaining about this as well, so of course it was up to me to make one.

As of September 2019, this website garners over 3,000 unique weekly visitors, and has allowed me to practice collecting feedback on a project in order to shape its development.
